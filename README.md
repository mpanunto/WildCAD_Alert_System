# WildCAD Alert System
Email alerts for new smoke checks and wildfires, pulled from WildCAD

In order for my Python environment to have access to my dummy gmail account (logging into the account and sending emails), I had to create an App Password. An app password is a password that is generated so that a third-party app can connect to your Gmail account. You then use it instead of your Google account password when using that app.
